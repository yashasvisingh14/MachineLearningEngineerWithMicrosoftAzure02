# Operationalizing Machine Learning
## Project Overview
In this project, I have worked with the Bank Marketing dataset. I have used Azure to configure a cloud-based machine learning production model, deploy it, and consume it. I will also create, publish, and consume a pipeline.
Dataset - https://automlsamplenotebookdata.blob.core.windows.net/automl-sample-notebook-data/bankmarketing_train.csv
The stpes to be followed :-
* Authentication
* Automated ML Experiment
* Deploy the best model
* Enable logging
* Swagger Documentation
* Consume model endpoints
* Create and publish a pipeline
